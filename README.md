# times_series

This project involves creating web client dashboard with functionality to provide insights into Pharma Sales Datasets. This app will allow for flexible application of multiple tools all embedded in its time_series.py package enabling the user the ability to do multiple univariate and multi-variate analysis on the datasets.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
clone repository on in your preferred directory
ensure requirements.txt is appearing in your directory
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
goto root directory of your cloned folder
run cmd 
run python venv "virtual_env name"
run "virtual_env name"\Scripts\activate to activate venv
navigate to the location of the requirements.txt file
run pip install -r requirements.txt
open up a code editor or ide in cmd (eg. "code ." for VisualStudio)
run streamlit run main_page.py to run the web app/dashboard
